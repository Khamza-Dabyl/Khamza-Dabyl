### Hello dear colleague ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Khamza** and I'm from **Kazakhstan**, **Astana**. <br>
I am a **web developer** and a **UI/UX designer** at the same time. <br>
I started doing web development literally a year ago. <br>
In parallel, combining with web design, there are already a **couple of projects in my portfolio**, <br>
which you can view here and prototypes of web products via the link in **Behance**.

My code may not seem clean enough or correct to you, but that's for now. <br>
**I'm always working** on it and I'm sure I'll start writing code cleanly and correctly in the near future.

I will be glad for tips and hints!
